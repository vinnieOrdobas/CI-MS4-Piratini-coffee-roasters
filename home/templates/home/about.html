                              When we first imagined P&Co., Bruce and I were baristas in a busy speciality coffee shop, and we knew what it take to brew good coffee: <strong>passion and dedication.</strong>
                              We are also passionate about growing plants and the natural world, so we decided to create our own roastery with beans produced only by high-quality, organic farmers who
                              care for nature as much as we do: we discovered that many people thought like us, that respect for the planet has to be the top priority.
