### Flow testing

Usual flow through the app:

- Home > Products > Bag > Checkout > Order confirmation > Profile
- Each page section (products/bags/checkouts) have controls that allow the user to go back and forth seamlessly.

The website as a whole was thought-through to simplify navigation for the customers, providing buttons/controls based on a known online shopping experience.
